; Declaration of variables
(declare-const y Int)
(declare-const res Int)
(declare-const i Int)

; Initialization of variables
; x is always 3 in multiplyBy3 function
(assert (= res 0))
(assert (= i 3))

; Loop Iterations
; Since x is 3, the loop runs 3 times. We unroll the loop manually.

; First iteration
(assert (= res y)) ; res = res + y, which is initially 0 + y
(assert (= i 2))   ; i = i - 1

; Second iteration
(assert (= res (+ res y)))
(assert (= i 1))

; Third iteration
(assert (= res (+ res y)))
(assert (= i 0))

; Final Assertion
; The assertion res == 3 * y
(assert (= res (* 3 y)))

; Check for satisfiability
(check-sat)

; If satisfiable, get the model
